## About

ETTA is a novel test-time adaptation approach that improves CLIP model performance through two key innovations:

1. **Adaptive Ensembling Module**: Intelligently filters and selects the most relevant prompts for each test sample
2. **Recursive Update Mechanism**: Dynamically updates class embeddings based on incoming test-time samples

The method adapts to test data without requiring retraining, making it efficient and practical for real-world deployment.

## Key Features

- **Adaptive Prompt Filtering**: Dynamically selects top-α% most relevant prompts per class based on image-class similarity
- **Recursive Cache Updates**: Continuously updates class representations using exponential moving average of test samples
- **Cache-based Knowledge Accumulation**: Maintains and refines knowledge during testing
- **Entropy-based Fusion**: Intelligently combines cached and original predictions
- **Support for Multiple CLIP Backbones**: Compatible with ViT-B/16 and RN50
- **Multi-dataset Processing**: Handles various datasets including ImageNet variants
- **Class-Specific Prompts (CSP) vs General Prompts (GP)**: Flexible prompt selection strategies


## Requirements

- Python 3.7
- PyTorch 1.12.1
- CUDA 11.3
- CLIP model
- Additional packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up a conda environment and ensure all necessary packages are installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.git 
cd ETTA

conda create -n tda python=3.7
conda activate tda

# The results are produced with PyTorch 1.12.1 and CUDA 11.3
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Setup

To set up all required datasets, please refer to the [DATASETS.md](./Doc/DATASETS.md) file.  
It includes step-by-step instructions for preparing datasets for both benchmarks used in this project.


## Configuration

The configuration for ETTA is in `configs/dataset.yaml` and can be tailored within the provided file to meet the needs of various datasets.

### Prompt Strategies

ETTA supports two prompt strategies that can be configured:

#### Class-Specific Prompts (CSP) - ETTA+
- Uses detailed, domain-specific descriptions for each class
- Loads prompts from JSON files (e.g., `CuPL_prompts_imagenet.json`)
- Combines detailed descriptions with template prompts
- Generally provides better performance through richer class representations
- Enable with: `csp: True` in the corresponding config file.

#### General Prompts (GP) - ETTA
- Uses only template-based prompts (e.g., "a photo of a {classname}")
- Simpler approach with fewer computational requirements
- Good baseline performance
- Enable with: `csp: False` in the corresponding config file.

### Hyperparameters

The main hyperparameter in ETTA is **alpha**, which controls the adaptive ensembling:

- **alpha: 0.2** in the corresponding config file: Uses top 20% of most relevant prompts per class


The alpha parameter determines the trade-off between prompt focus and robustness in the adaptive prompt filtering mechanism.

## Running ETTA

### Basic Usage

```bash
python ETTA.py --datasets caltech101 --backbone ViT-B/16 --data-root "./DATA" --tta-approach "ETTA_PLUS" --config "configs"
```

### Command Line Arguments

- `--datasets`: Datasets to process (e.g., "caltech101", "I/A/V/R/S" for ImageNet variants)
- `--data-root`: Path to datasets directory (default: "./DATA")
- `--backbone`: CLIP model backbone ("ViT-B/16" or "RN50")
- `--tta-approach`: Test-time adaptation approach ("ETTA" or "ETTA_PLUS")
- `--config`: Path to configuration directory containing dataset-specific YAML files (default: "configs")


### Examples

```bash
# Run on Caltech101 with ViT-B/16 backbone using ETTA_PLUS
python ETTA.py --datasets caltech101 --backbone ViT-B/16 --data-root "./DATA" --tta-approach "ETTA_PLUS" --config "configs"

# Run on ImageNet Adversarial (A) with RN50 backbone using ETTA
python ETTA.py --datasets AI --backbone RN50 --data-root "./DATA" --tta-approach "ETTA" --config "configs"

```

### Supported Datasets

- **ImageNet Variants**: I (ImageNet), A (ImageNet-A), V (ImageNet-V), R (ImageNet-R), S (ImageNet-S)
- **Standard Datasets**: caltech101, dtd, eurosat, fgvc, food101, oxford_flowers, oxford_pets, stanford_cars, sun397, ucf101

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Loads CLIP model and creates empty knowledge caches for each class
2. **Adaptive Prompt Filtering**: For each test image, selects top-α% most relevant prompts per class
3. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts image features using CLIP encoder
4. **Recursive Cache Updates**: Updates class embeddings using exponential moving average of test samples
5. **Entropy-based Fusion**: Combines cached and original predictions using confidence weighting
6. **Continuous Adaptation**: The model becomes progressively better at recognizing patterns in the test data

## Performance

ETTA typically shows significant improvements over baseline CLIP models, especially in domain adaptation scenarios. The combination of adaptive ensembling and recursive updates often outperforms original CLIP predictions by:

- Leveraging learned knowledge from the test data
- Adaptively selecting the most relevant prompts for each sample
- Continuously refining class representations during testing
